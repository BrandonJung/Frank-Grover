true Ugh, people are so careless nowadays. Look at all that litter strewn around Beaty.
false Hey, I am looking for bones of the blue whale skeleton. Have you come across any on the campus?
true Ah, you say you are looking for bones? Well...
true I was going to add this one to my biodiversity collection, but if you get rid of the litter, you can have it.
false How will I drag the trash into the dumpster all by myself?
true Oh Grover, I bet you are a smart dog. You can click the litter and drag it into the dumpster nearby.
false Of course! I will be back when I have cleaned the campus.

true Try standing close to the dumpster when you are dragging the litter into the dumpster.
