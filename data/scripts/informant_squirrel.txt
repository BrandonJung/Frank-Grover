false Hey there, Squirrel, I'm looking for whale bones to return to the Beaty museum. Have you seen any?
true Aw nuts, my cousin living down in the forest had his whole house destroyed by a flipper. Really devastating for the family. Just awful. The insurance is a nightmare...
true Say, why don't you head over there and try and get it out of his tree?
false But I am only a medium-sized dog! How will I reach it?

true Keep the ball... you never know when it might come in handy.
false Gee, thanks, Squirrel!
true It was nuttin... I mean, it was nothing...
